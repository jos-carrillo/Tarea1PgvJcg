[Verse 1]
I know the feeling in the morning when the sun
Lights the dust that hangs in orbit as you're waking up
And for a moment, you feel weightless, then the panic comes
First a drizzle, then a downpour, then an endless flood
You start to run
Brothers in the summer dust
Far enough
That no one's ever catching us

[Verse 2]
I know the feeling when the light begins to fade
And the dishes in the sink look like a mountain range
You try to will yourself to stand, but you can't find the strength
Threw your head against the cold glass of the windowpane
You're afraid
Of what happens when it finally breaks
And all that remains
Is shattered glass and constant gray
[Chorus]
Bruised and paper cut
I built a thousand paper cranes for good luck
But I can't protect you
I had my chance and I fucked it up

[Verse 3]
I stare for years at all the duct tape on the door
Held together like a patient in a trauma ward
I still don't know what the fuck they kept it for
This house is haunted, I can't live in here anymore
All the time
Realized you weren't on the other side
Overnight
Can't imagine what that must've felt like

[Chorus]
Bruised and paper cut
I built a thousand paper cranes for good luck
But I can't protect you
I had my chance and I fucked it up

[Bridge]
I had that nightmare again
You're five and you're helpless
Trapped under the wreckage
You reach out your hand and I'm weak, I can't save you
No matter how often it plays in my head, I can't lift it up
You might also like
The Paris of Nowhere
The Wonder Years
Oldest Daughter
The Wonder Years
Cigarettes & Saints
The Wonder Years
[Chorus]
Bruised and paper cut
I built a thousand paper cranes for good luck
And I can't protect you
I had my chance and I fucked it all up
I fucked it all up
