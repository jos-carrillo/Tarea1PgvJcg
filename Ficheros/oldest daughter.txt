[Verse 1]
You drift in with the wind
And use a library computer to check in
"You can't sleep at the table, ma'am
You're scaring the kids"
And the fall's getting cold
You try to catch salt air in an envelope
So you can send it home
Sit by the bay alone, sun on your skin

[Pre-Chorus]
Another day up in flames
Another cop that knows your name
(That knows your name)
These assholes always sound the same
[Chorus]
Madelyn, I don't think that I'll see you again
Madelyn, I love you but we both know how this ends
Madelyn, the tide is coming in

[Verse 2]
You pull out a cig
Imagine the air in your lungs as gasoline
Lighted the fucker up
Some people get all the luck
Some gotta live
Can't find an address
Nobody seems to know where you're living at
I got you a birthday gift
I wanna send it with pictures of my kids

[Pre-Chorus]
Another day up in flames
(Day up in flames)
Another year that looks the same

[Chorus]
Madelyn, I don't think that I'll see you again
Madelyn, I love you but we both know how this ends
Madelyn, I heard that the tide is coming in
You're lost in the grey
With two broken legs
Trying to swim
[Bridge]
(Madelyn) Watch the clouds
(Madelyn) Empty out
(Madelyn) Flood the ground

(Madelyn) Try to sleep
(Madelyn) In the steam
(Madelyn) From the street

[Chorus]
Madelyn, I don't think that I'll see you again
Madelyn, I love you but we both know how this ends
Madelyn, I heard that the tide is coming in
You're lost in the grey
With two broken legs
Trying to swim
