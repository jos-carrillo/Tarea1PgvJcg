[Verse 1]
I don't wanna die
At least not without you
Alone here in the August heat
And the shadows of the afternoon
I don't wanna die
But I'm petrified of getting up
There's a draft coming from underneath
A door I swore I'd painted shut

[Verse 2]
I'm staring at the sun
Even though I'm sure that I'm asleep
And it's expanding out to swallow us
I can feel the low persistent heat
I don't try to run
I wait out there on the porch swing
And in the orange glow, an eerie calm
A continent slides off into the sea
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna stay
Under the low clouds of a humid heat
I'm singing softly out of tune
I can nеver find the key
I don't wanna diе
Or maybe I do
'Cause everything's so fucking dark
You found me crying in the other room

[Chorus]
It's been years since I've been low like this
I don't like me
Playing piano with a broken wrist
I don't like me
And I've been waiting at the windowsill
I don't like me
I need you to know I love you still
I don't like me
