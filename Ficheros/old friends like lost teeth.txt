[Verse 1: Dan Campbell]
I woke up and caught my breath
The sun had gone down on Berlin
We lost you last week
But you walked into the room again

[Verse 2: Dan Campbell]
And you never took the ski mask off
When I asked you to, you turned away
And reappeared with new tattoos
The timbre of your voice had changed
[Pre-Chorus 1: Dan Campbell]
I know it's a bad dream

[Chorus: Dan Campbell]
But oh, I wanna build, wanna build you back from memory
Something that can stay, that can stay here when you go
'Cause I know all the people in my dreams are just me
They're all telling me what I know already
I'm caught in the gray, drifting out herе all alone

[Verse 3: Dan Campbell]
There's a stillnеss in the air
In the late September dusk
And the maple leaves come
Crashing down all at once
And paint the pavement crimson red
I'm catatonic, wandering off
A song about death in my head
And I can't help but hum along

[Pre-Chorus 2: Dan Campbell]
It feels like a bad dream

[Chorus: Dan Campbell]
But oh, I wanna build, wanna build you back from memory
Something that can stay, that can stay here when you go
'Cause I know all the people in my dreams are just me
They're all telling me what I know already
I'm caught in the gray, drifting out here all alone

[Bridge: Josh Martin & Matt Brasch]
Old friends like lost teeth
I'm always caught in the space where you used to be
Old friends like lost teeth
In the space where you used to be
Old friends like lost—

[Chorus: Dan Campbell]
I wanna build, wanna build you back from memory
Something that can stay, that can stay here when you go
'Cause I know all the people in my dreams are just me
They're all telling me what I know already
I'm caught in the gray, drifting out here all alone
Yeah, I know all the people in my dreams are just me
They're all telling me what I know already
I'm caught in the gray, drifting out here all alone
