[Verse 1]
Been writing songs about death so long that I wish I could just go numb
And think of funeral processions and the way they fuck the traffic up
Another call in the dark that takes the air out of my broken lungs
Been writing songs about death too long
I need to stop

[Verse 2]
Vacated bodies, gracefully collapsed, and it never stops adding up
My skin too thin for anything, oh, I know I make myself hard to love
These small memorials that I hold nightly out in front of everyone
I sing them songs about death and they sing along
It's gotta stop
