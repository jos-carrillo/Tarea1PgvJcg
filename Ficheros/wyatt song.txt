[Verse 1]
I recorded your heartbeat
It's one thirty-three
The tempo's in my blood now
I hum it when I'm lonely
I recorded your heartbeat
I stared at your knees
I wondered which one's gonna be
The bad one in your thirties

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then I drove you home
Listening to "God Only Knows"
When all that I know is
[Chorus]
Your name, your name, your name, your name's
The only one I like
I'm half-awake, caught in the way
You breathe at night
I'm low and I'm scared
But I'm on your side (I'm on your side)
Your name, your name, your namе, your name's
The only one I likе

[Verse 2]
I found glass in the garden
Dug it up with my thumb
I won't let you cut your feet
When you learn to run

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you learned to say "moon"
So we waved from your room
You called to it like it might come to you

[Chorus]
Your name, your name, your name, your name's
The only one I like
I'm half-awake, caught in the way
You breathe at night
I'm low and I'm scared
But I'm on your side (I'm on your side)
Your name, your name, your name, your name's
The only one I like
You might also like
Oldest Daughter
The Wonder Years
Doors I Painted Shut
The Wonder Years
Cigarettes & Saints
The Wonder Years
[Bridge]
I watched you sitting silently
Staring at your door
In all your little loneliness
I came in quiet and slept on your floor
And the green light from your smoke alarm
Flickers off and on
Like an alien abduction
Like a distant dawn
I've never been so afraid of failing at anything
And I'm glad that you don't know how bad it is (How bad it is)
Well, I'm gonna go, start to dig, plant the seed, keep the birds away
Gonna grow you a place safer than this

[Chorus]
Your name, your name, your name, your name's
The only one I like
I'm half-awake, caught in the way
You breathe at night
I'm low and I'm scared
But I'm on your side
Your name, your name, your name, your name's
The only one I like, oh
