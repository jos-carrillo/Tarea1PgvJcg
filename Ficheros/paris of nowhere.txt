[Verse 1: Dan Campbell]
We're building shrines to Saint Nick Foles
In the windows, in the living rooms
I'm playing "Dancing with a Ghost"
In the soft light of the afternoon
I'm alone in the house where your sister died

[Verse 2: Dan Campbell]
We're building shrines to Saint Nick Foles
In the churches, in the alleyways
I watched the river overflow
From the Schuylkill in the pouring rain
I'm alone in the house where your sister died
On the block that you lived your entire life
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Campbell]
And I takе the same train I did at nineteen
And wе danced on the benches in an empty Market East

[Chorus: Dan Campbell]
Throw me into the Delaware
And leave me down at the bottom there
The black lung of the east coast
The Paris of nowhere
Into the Delaware
And leave me down at the bottom there
Desperate, kind, and cutthroat
The Paris of nowhere
(The Paris of nowhere)

[Verse 3: Dan Campbell]
We're planting gardens in the potholes
No one comes to fill them in
I'll love you when nobody else will
All shoulder chips and paper skin
You're a kid swinging off of a traffic light
You're a block party outside a junkyard fire

[Chorus: Dan Campbell]
Throw me into the Delaware
And leave me down at the bottom there
The black lung of the east coast
The Paris of nowhere
Into the Delaware
And leave me down at the bottom there
Desperate, kind, and cutthroat
The Paris of nowhere

[Bridge: Dan Campbell & Matt Brasch]
Two feet of snow on the ground
And it's still coming down
So I'm gonna dig you out
I'm gonna dig you out
It must get lonely without Colleen and Cheryl around
I'm gonna dig you out
I'm gonna dig you out
Still got the flowers we found taped to the door of our house
I'm gonna dig you out
I'm gonna dig you out
You were always looking out

[Chorus]
Throw me into the Delaware
And leave me down at the bottom there
The black lung of the east coast
The Paris of nowhere
Into the Delaware
And leave me down at the bottom there
Desperate, kind, and cutthroat
The Paris of nowhere
The Paris of nowhere
The Paris of nowhere
